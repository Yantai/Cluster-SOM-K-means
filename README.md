# Cluster-SOM-K-means
Write programs to implement K-means clustering and a self- organizing map (SOM), with the prototype lying on a two-dimensional 
grid. Apply them to the columns of the human tumor microarray data, using K = 2, 5, 10, 20 centroids for both.  Demonstrate that 
as the size of the SOM neighborhood is taken to be smaller and smaller, the SOM solution becomes more similar to the K-means 
solution.
